This is the home of my personal times, ranks and scores on [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

Note that only those dates are included on which I participated in a *"competitive"* manner (i.e., being available at 6am CET and having a decent IDE).

In case you wonder, I used Rust in 2021/2023 (solutions [here](https://github.com/M1ngXU/aoc-rs)). The first half of 2021 also in JavaScript.
