This is the home of my personal times, ranks and scores on [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

Note that only those dates are included on which I participated in a *"competitive"* manner (i.e., being available at 6am CET and having a decent IDE).

In case you wonder, I use Python for competing starting from 2022 (solutions [here](https://github.com/phoyh/aoc-py)). Before it was JavaScript (solutions [here](https://github.com/phoyh/aoc-js)).
